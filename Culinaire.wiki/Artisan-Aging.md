Artisan aging is a process used for producing new food items and ingredients. It requires a lot of fungi, so you may want a [[fungal composter|Fungal Composter]]. The longer a product is aged in the cask, the higher quality it will be, increasing its satisfaction values.

## Aging Cask

The aging cask is a block used for all artisan aging features. A lot of fungi must be placed in the fungus slot with your input items in the input slots. Aging casks will update at the beginning of each day rather than after a set timer, meaning that they will instantly update if you sleep.

Aging casks are made with the recipe below, accepting any fungus, only accepting Nether wood planks:<br>

## Products
### Cheese
Cheese is made with one milk bucket in the first input slot, and one [[salt shard|Salt Pillars]] in the second input slot. It takes 20 days to fully age. Consuming a well aged cheese wheel produces a lot of satisfaction. You can also split it into two cheese wedges by crafting a cheese wheel with any sword in a [[culinary table|Cooking#Culinary Table]]. Cheese wedges grant half of the satisfaction of their full wheel form, but they're much more cost effective to use in cooking.

### Butter
Butter is a weird item. It is made in the aging ask with only one milk bucket and takes 2 days to fully age. Butter that has only aged one day can be taken out and used, but it has a chance to melt in your inventory, entirely wasting it. Better off just waiting the extra day... Of course, butter is useful for [[cooking|Cooking]]

### Wine
Wine is made using [[fruit juice|Cooking#Fruit-Juice]] in the aging cask. It grants more satisfaction based on how well aged it is, and that is about it.
