Culinaire currently adds one fishing 'environment' but plans to add various new rewards and mechanics for fishing in different biomes. Stay tuned!

## Universal
Stuff that can be caught anywhere. Currently, this only includes [[salt pillars|Salt Pillars]].

## Tropical
Tropical biomes include lukewarm and warm oceans, lush caves, and mangrove swamps. Basically, anywhere that tropical fish spawn. Here you may find increased tropical fish catches, and also lobsters.
### Lobster

Lobsters are relatively common in tropical environments. They have various culinary uses such as [[lobster rolls|Cooking#Snacks]] and [[lobster stew|Cooking#Soups]]. There are also rumors of a rare variant, blending in with the nighttime sea... But that's a rumor lmao, it's not true. Or is it?
