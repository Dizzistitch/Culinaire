The fungal composter is a block used for mass producing fertilizer and fungi, and extracting materials from meat items. To function, any mushroom or fungus (including nether wart and sculk) must be inserted into the fungus slot, along with a meat item in the input slot. The fungus will slowly consume the meat, cloning the fungus, leaving behind materials depending on the type of meat, and of course producing fungal compost.

If it is not obvious, fungal compost functionally acts the same as bone meal. You can even craft it into white dye or bone blocks, which is entirely intended.<br>
