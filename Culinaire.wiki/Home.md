## About
Culinaire is a dataapack intended to add onto farming, fishing, and most importantly, cooking. The pack is still in early development so many features may be incomplete or unstable.
Culinaire currently adds [[new soups and stews|Cooking#Soups]] made in a [[pot|Cooking#Soup Pot]], new [[dishes|Cooking#Dishes]] made at a [[culinary table|Cooking#Culinary Table]], new ingredients, a new [[fishable|Fishing]] creature, and more!
## Installing
Culinaire is installed like all other datapacks. Download the file from Planet Minecraft or GitHub and insert it into your world's datapack folder. You will also need the resourcepack which is found on the same pages.
### Smithed (IMPORTANT)
Culinaire uses Smithed libraries to make its development much smoother, and to make it compatible with other datapacks. You can download Smithed libraries [here!](https://nightly.link/Smithed-MC/Libraries/workflows/nightly-build/main/packs.zip)
### With other datapacks
Sadly, keeping datapacks compatible is tricky. A big problem you may have is resourcepack conflicts. If you are running multiple datapacks that require resourcepacks like Culinaire, I recommend Mitochondria, from the same developers as Smithed, for merging resourcepacks!
