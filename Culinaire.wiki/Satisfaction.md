Satisfaction is a new mechanic used as incentive to cook more complex food items. It is indicated by a bar of 10 cake slices displayed above the hotbar for a brief moment after consuming an item which increases satisfaction.
## Buffs
At 1-2 bars, you will gain a slight speed boost along with an increase in luck.<br>
At 3-7 bars, your speed boost will be increased slightly along with your luck boost.<br>
At 8+ bars, you will be notably faster, and have excellent luck, and will gain two additional max health (one additional heart)
## Decay
Satisfaction decays at a rate of 2/1000ths of a bar per second. This means one bar will fully decay after eight and a half minutes. If the player has poison, hunger, or nausea, this decay will be doubled.
