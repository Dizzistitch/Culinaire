Culinary tables are a crafting station made specifically for making new food items. They come in all vanilla wood types. They are made with two matching planks, two bowls, and two of any polished stone in the top slots.

The culinary table GUI is the same as the vanilla crafting table.

Soup pots are the new way to make [[soups and stews|Cooking#Soups]]. You can also replace the iron ingots and iron nuggets with terracotta and bricks or gold ingots and gold nuggets respectively to make a terracotta or gold pot. Iron pots can be placed on the ground or hung from ceilings but other variants can only be placed on the ground.

A soup pot requires heat below it to be able to cook. This can be fire, lit campfires, lava, or magma. When heated, add your ingredients, and when finished, scoop out your soup with a bowl!
